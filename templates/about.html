          Education:
          I am currently studying at University ðŸŽ“, pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science degree from Vistula University. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in various programming languages and technologies.

          Skills:
          I am proficient in a wide range of technologies, including Python, HTML5, CSS3, Django, Flask, Jinja, Linux, Pandas, SQL, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and more. I am also adept at version control using Git and GitHub, and I have a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms. Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning PostgreSQL, FastAPI, and honing my problem-solving abilities through platforms like LeetCode.

          Interests:
          Outside of the tech world, I have a passion for Cybersport, particularly CS2 ðŸŽ®, and I am a proud supporter of Manchester United Football Club âš½. I believe in the power of sports to unite people and foster a sense of camaraderie.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, you'll often find me immersed in programming books like "Python 101" and "Cracking the Coding Interview," as well as self-improvement books like "Atomic Habits" ðŸ“š. I am committed to lifelong learning and continuous growth, both personally and professionally.
